## Installation Guide

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the app is using Docker, specifically using the Docker Compose file provided which starts and containerises all required services. For this the only thing you need to install on your device is Docker.

**Recommended Path**

Follow the installation guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) to install the Docker Desktop app which provides the Docker Engine, Docker Desktop App, Docker Compose and more useful features

**Alternative Path**

Docker also provides a guide for installing just the Docker Engine [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) which may be useful for advanced users who do not need or want the additional Docker Desktop functionality, note that you may need to additionally install the Docker Compose plugin which will be needed to run the Compose file, instructions for that can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

**Post Docker install**

Once you have the Docker preqrequisite installed you can run the full stack by opening a command prompt (cmd/powershell on Windows, Terminal on MacOS/Linux) and run the following command

```.bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Open a browser and enter 'http://localhost:8080/', this will take you to the apps main page.
