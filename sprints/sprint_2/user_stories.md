## Summary of Changes

This new set of user stories introduces more detailed aspects of gameplay, though we are still in the process of figuring out more concrete user interactions. The idea of an oracle that interjects with helpful advice is introduced. Other user stories involving resource management and targetted actions are introduced, designed to emulate optimization problems that could make gameplay more challenging and therefore more engaging for the user.
