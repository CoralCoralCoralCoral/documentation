### Customer Meeting and Analysis
•	Concerns were raised over how many members of the group were missing. This was dealt with later, and explanations were made for those group members missing.
•	The group explained that they chose to work on the epidemic response game rather than the de-escalation training game.
•	Mechanics for how we would simulate the spread of a disease using the agent model was explained to the customer and how we would map where agents were using spaces. Feedback from this was to keep the simulation simple to begin with as it could be hard to implement and if we start to complex then we will not be able to tell if the simulation is working and which parts are not working.
•	Basic user story and model was shown to the customer and the feedback given was to chose an already established UI system rather than build our own as that could be quite complex.
•	Overall feedback was to start with a simple model to begin with and if we have time to expand upon that simple model.
