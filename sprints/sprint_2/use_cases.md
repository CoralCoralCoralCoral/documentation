### 5 (v1) [[User story 8 v1]](user_stories.md)

**Title:** Implement Actions Within a Geographic Scope

**Purpose:** As a user, I want to implement actions within a given geographic scope so that I can use resources efficiently.

**Associated User Stories:** 8 (v1)
**Actors:** User

**Preconditions:** The map displays distinct geographic regions with selectable areas. The system supports targeted actions such as testing, lockdowns or resource distribution. 

**Main Flow:** Regular flow of activities.

- **Step 1** - The user selects a specific region on the map. 

- **Step 2** - The system highlights the chosen region, showing relevant data (e.g. infection rates, available resources). 

- **Step 3** - The user implements an action (e.g. deploying a testing strategy or imposing restrictions) within the selected region.

- **Step 4** - The system updates the simulation to reflect the effects of the action in the chosen area. 

**Alternative Flow:** Exceptions to main flow.

**Exception:** If the user tries to apply actions to an unselected region, the system provides a prompt to select a scope first. 

**Postcondition:** Actions are successfully applied within the specified geographic scope, optimising resource use.
