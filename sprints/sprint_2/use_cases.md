# Use Cases

## 1 (v1)

### 1. Title -- Implement Actions Within a Geographic Scope

### 2. Purpose -- As a user, I want to implement actions within a given geographic scope so that I can use resources efficiently

### 3. Associated User Stories -- 6 (v1)

### 4. Actors -- The User

### 5. Preconditions -- The map displays distinct geographic regions with selectable areas. The system supports targeted actions such as testing, lockdowns, or resource distribution. 

### 6. Main Flow -- regular flow of activities

#### Step 1 - The user selects a specific region on the map. 

#### Step 2 - The system highlights the chosen region, showing relevant data (e.g., infection rates, available resources). 

#### Step 3 - The user implements an action (e.g., deploying a testing strategy or imposing restrictions) within the selected region.

#### Step 4 - The system updates the simulation to reflect the effects of the action in the chosen area. 

### 7. Alternative Flow #number -- exceptions to main flow

#### Exception 1 - If the user tries to apply actions to an unselected region, the system provides a prompt to select a scope first. 

### 8. Postcondition -- Actions are successfully applied within the specified geographic scope, optimizing resource use. 



## 2 (v1)

### 1. Title -- Manage Resources for Realistic and Challenging Gameplay 

### 2. Purpose -- As a user, I want to manage resources so that the simulation is realistic and challenging. 

### 3. Associated User Stories -- 7 (v1)

### 4. Actors -- The User

### 5. Preconditions -- The game includes a resource management system (e.g., funding, medical supplies, personnel). The simulation provides feedback on resource usage and availability. 

### 6. Main Flow -- regular flow of activities

#### Step 1 - The user starts with a set amount of resources displayed in the interface.  

#### Step 2 - The user allocates resources to different actions (e.g., deploying testing kits, hiring medical staff). 

#### Step 3 - The user monitors resource trends and adjusts strategies to avoid depletion. 

### 7. Alternative Flow #number -- exceptions to main flow

#### Exception 1 - If resources run low, the system provides alerts and suggests ways to obtain more (e.g., reallocating or prioritizing). 

### 8. Postcondition -- The resource management system adds depth to the gameplay, making it both realistic and challenging.
