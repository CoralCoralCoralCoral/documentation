# Sprint 6: 2024-12-04 to 2024-12-10

## Sprint Goal
The goal of this final sprint was deliver all the essential missing components into one finished product.

## Sprint Overview
We wanted to fix the de-serialisation bug, which prevented the user from implementing surveillance and intervention actions throught the UI.]

We wanted to implement the oracle into the final version.

We wanted to impose a resource constrant on the user, so that they would have to be strategic in their decision making.

We wanted to implement an end game condition. 

We wanted to display the historic data for the user to evaluate their perfomance.

## Sprint Review
The de-serialisation bug was fixed and the UI can sucessfully implement surveillance and intervention actions.

The oracle now has been implemented into the UI according to the customer requirements.

There is a resource constrant, such that surveillance and intervention actions have a cost associated with them.

There is no explict end game condition implemented into the game at this time.

We were not able to implement the end game report, as other task took precedent.
