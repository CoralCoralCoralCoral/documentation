# Sprint 6: 2024-12-04 to 2024-12-10

## Sprint Goal
The goal of this final sprint was deliver all the essential missing components into one finished product.

## Sprint Overview
We wanted to fix the de-serialisation bug, which prevented the user from implementing surveillance and intervention actions throught the UI.]

We wanted to implement the oracle into the final version.

We wanted to impose a resource constrant on the user, so that they would have to be strategic in their decision making.

We wanted to implement an end game condition. 

We wanted to display the historic data for the user to evaluate their perfomance.

## Sprint Review
The de-serialisation bug was fixed and the UI can sucessfully implement surveillance and intervention actions.

The oracle now has been implemented into the UI according to the customer requirements.

There is a resource constrant, such that surveillance and intervention actions have a cost associated with them.

There is no explict end game condition implemented into the game at this time.

We were not able to implement the end game report, as other task took precedent.

 Key Discussion Points

1. Funding Challenges

• Persistent lack of funding affecting operational capacity and strategy implementation.

• Action steps requiring funding allocation remain delayed or under-prioritized.

2. Global Strategy Overview

• Current strategies are fragmented; need better alignment with global-level priorities.

• Testing and piloting could provide clarity and proof-of-concept (e.g., demo testing scenarios).

3. Resource Allocation

• Limited resources impacting service availability, particularly in healthcare services.

• Uneven distribution of resources leads to delayed deployments and increased costs.

4. Performance and Tracking

• Need for a mechanism to track outcomes and optimize resource allocation effectively.

• Suggested graphs and data visualization tools to highlight performance metrics.

5. Testing Strategy

• Demo testing proposed to measure strategy effectiveness.

• Insights to be derived from user feedback and real-time adjustments.



3. Key Challenges

• Insufficient funding resources leading to bottlenecks in implementation.

• Difficulty in balancing short-term action costs with long-term strategy goals.

• Limited tools for tracking real-time performance and outcomes.

• Lack of standardized testing phases and evaluation metrics.

 Proposed Action Plan

1. Action Items

• Identify funding opportunities and potential cost-sharing models.

• Initiate small-scale demo tests in key regions to validate assumptions.

• Develop a series of performance graphs to better visualize resource utilization and impact.

2. Responsible Parties

• Funding strategy

• Demo testing and tracking

3. Timeline

• Demo testing phase

4. Dependencies


• Feedback loop mechanisms for continuous improvements.



5. Follow-Up Steps

• Schedule the next meeting to evaluate the progress of demo testing.

• Review outcomes from resource tracking mechanisms.
