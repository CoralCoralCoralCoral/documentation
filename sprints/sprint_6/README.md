 Key Discussion Points

1. Funding Challenges

• Persistent lack of funding affecting operational capacity and strategy implementation.

• Action steps requiring funding allocation remain delayed or under-prioritized.

2. Global Strategy Overview

• Current strategies are fragmented; need better alignment with global-level priorities.

• Testing and piloting could provide clarity and proof-of-concept (e.g., demo testing scenarios).

3. Resource Allocation

• Limited resources impacting service availability, particularly in healthcare services.

• Uneven distribution of resources leads to delayed deployments and increased costs.

4. Performance and Tracking

• Need for a mechanism to track outcomes and optimize resource allocation effectively.

• Suggested graphs and data visualization tools to highlight performance metrics.

5. Testing Strategy

• Demo testing proposed to measure strategy effectiveness.

• Insights to be derived from user feedback and real-time adjustments.



3. Key Challenges

• Insufficient funding resources leading to bottlenecks in implementation.

• Difficulty in balancing short-term action costs with long-term strategy goals.

• Limited tools for tracking real-time performance and outcomes.

• Lack of standardized testing phases and evaluation metrics.

 Proposed Action Plan

1. Action Items

• Identify funding opportunities and potential cost-sharing models.

• Initiate small-scale demo tests in key regions to validate assumptions.

• Develop a series of performance graphs to better visualize resource utilization and impact.

2. Responsible Parties

• Funding strategy

• Demo testing and tracking

3. Timeline

• Demo testing phase

4. Dependencies


• Feedback loop mechanisms for continuous improvements.



5. Follow-Up Steps

• Schedule the next meeting to evaluate the progress of demo testing.

• Review outcomes from resource tracking mechanisms.
