## Meeting Minutes

### Meeting 1

Date:04-12-2024
Participants: Team Coral
Venue: University of Bath

Agenda
1. Review progress and updates on tasks.

2. Discuss ongoing challenges and solutions.

3. Finalize deliverables for the sprint.


Key Points and Discussion



1. Progress Updates:

• System Design for User Activity Monitoring:

• Proposal to set up a system to track active users and generate reports based on specific metrics.

• Discussed pricing models and strategies for handling user data and system resources.

• Documentation and User Manual:

• Progress on finalizing the product documentation and user manual.

• Aiming for a polished final draft by Friday, with live testing scheduled for Saturday.

2. Challenges and Solutions:

• Resource Management and Cost Implications:

• Highlighted challenges in balancing costs associated with resource allocation (e.g., testing frequency, hospital capacity simulation).

• Discussed trade-offs between faster implementation and higher costs versus slower, resource-efficient methods.

• Simulation Adjustments:

• Suggestions for improving simulation outputs to better represent healthcare resource management (e.g., equipment, staff, and hospital capacity).

• Documentation Format and Accessibility:

• Debated the format of the sprint documentation to ensure accessibility.

• Suggested linking sprints and their respective user stories for easier navigation.



3. Deliverables and Next Steps:

• Documentation Deliverables:

• Include all relevant user stories, API guides, and simulation details.

• Ensure modularity to enable seamless updates and usability for developers and end-users.

• Testing and Review:

• Conduct live testing on Saturday (07-12-2024)  to validate changes and finalize the user manual.

• Review routing and API issues to ensure functionality aligns with documentation.

• Some pending tasks involve addressing bugs in routing and ensuring the system’s robustness for handling post requests.

• Plan to resolve these issues in time for the next sprint.

Next Agenda before Deadline (13-12-2024)

 Key Discussion Points

1. Funding Challenges

• Persistent lack of funding affecting operational capacity and strategy implementation.

• Action steps requiring funding allocation remain delayed or under-prioritized.

2. Global Strategy Overview

• Current strategies are fragmented; need better alignment with global-level priorities.

• Testing and piloting could provide clarity and proof-of-concept (e.g., demo testing scenarios).

3. Resource Allocation

• Limited resources impacting service availability, particularly in healthcare services.

• Uneven distribution of resources leads to delayed deployments and increased costs.

4. Performance and Tracking

• Need for a mechanism to track outcomes and optimize resource allocation effectively.

• Suggested graphs and data visualization tools to highlight performance metrics.

5. Testing Strategy

• Demo testing proposed to measure strategy effectiveness.

• Insights to be derived from user feedback and real-time adjustments.



3. Key Challenges

• Insufficient funding resources leading to bottlenecks in implementation.

• Difficulty in balancing short-term action costs with long-term strategy goals.

• Limited tools for tracking real-time performance and outcomes.

• Lack of standardized testing phases and evaluation metrics.

 Proposed Action Plan

1. Action Items

• Identify funding opportunities and potential cost-sharing models.

• Initiate small-scale demo tests in key regions to validate assumptions.

• Develop a series of performance graphs to better visualize resource utilization and impact.

2. Responsible Parties

• Funding strategy

• Demo testing and tracking

3. Timeline

• Demo testing phase

4. Dependencies


• Feedback loop mechanisms for continuous improvements.



5. Follow-Up Steps

• Schedule the next meeting to evaluate the progress of demo testing.

• Review outcomes from resource tracking mechanisms.
