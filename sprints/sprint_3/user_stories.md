## Summary of Changes

Some user stories are introduced that address the non-gameplay user experience aspects of the game, such as being able to pause, resume, quit and initialize new games. Some stories are also introduced that capture more concrete user needs with respect to gameplay, such as being able to filter and efficiently sift through swathes of information generated by the simulation, as well as perform more customized queries on the data.
