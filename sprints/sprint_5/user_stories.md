## Summary of Changes

This initial set of user stories covers the generic gameplay elements we expect out of the game, as well as the educational aspects we intend to cover. We intend to expand on these use cases as we figure out more about the complexities of this type of simulation game as it applies to our collective abilities and time constraints.
