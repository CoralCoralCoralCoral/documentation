## Summary of Changes

With this set of new user stories, we are beginning to hone in on more specific gameplay mechanics that begin to describe a concrete picture of how the user will interact with the game. These include more specific types of Oracle behaviours, as well as the specific classes of actions the user can be expected to perform: surveillance, intervention and intervention efficiency development actions.
