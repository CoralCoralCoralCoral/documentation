We are Team Coral and this is our demonstration of our Serious Game, Epidemic Response Simulator.   

You have been informed that a disease has broken out in your country and the government has chosen you to lead the epidemic response team.
Your goal is to stop the spread of the disease, while limiting the damage the disease does, both economically and by number of dead. 
You have to manage your resources wisely to best combat the epidemic. Be warned the infection rates you are aware of are not necessarily the real infection rates. 
To better understand the disease, you must invest in testing. If you manage to stop the disease from spreading you have completed your task and have won the game, but at what cost? 
You can see after the game the rate of spread, the number of dead and the GDP impact of the epidemic as well as how your actions impacted these. 
Learn from your mistakes and successes to improve your strategies for next time you play.

As our target user was a healthcare professional or student studying epidemics, we realised that our simulation must be very real life accurate. 
Therefore, we have used real peer reviewed models to simulate our epidemic.

To start the game, press the start button. **Press the start button.** Then you can customize you game as you like **show the adjustable factors** or you can press one of easy, medium or hard presets to start the game **show the buttons then start the game**. As you can see the game will take some time to load, then you can begin playing the game. 
At any point you can pause and play the game using the pause/play button. **Demonstrate by pausing the game then playing.**

You can see important metrics about the epidemic on the right-hand side.
**Hover over Metrics. Explain the meaning of the metrics. Explain testing and how this is the only way you can track the spread of the disease.**

The goal of the game is to stop the spread of the disease and to do this you can implement actions. 
**Explain the actions and demonstrate them in action.** However, actions cost money. **Hover over the resources at the bottom of the UI.** Therefore, you must spend your money wisely. 

Within the game map there are different jurisdictions. You can apply actions to effect only specific jurisdictions. This can help limiting the cost of your actions.

The oracle will pop up to help you. **Demonstrate the oracle popping up.**

Once you have **met the victory condition** the game will end and you will be able to see the course od the epidemic and how your actions have influenced it. 
To learn how to better combat an epidemic, try playing again using the new knowledge and trying new strategies to best prevent the disease from inflicting too much damage.
